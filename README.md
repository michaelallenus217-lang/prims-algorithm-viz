# Prim's Algorithm Interactive Visualization

Interactive step-by-step visualization of Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.

## Features
- Real-time graph updates showing MST construction
- Color-coded vertices (green=in tree, blue=in fringe, gray=unexplored)
- Interactive navigation through algorithm steps
- Keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation

## Usage
- **Next/Previous buttons**: Navigate through steps
- **Reset button**: Return to initial state
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: 
  - Arrow keys (← →) to navigate
  - 'R' to reset

## Algorithm
Executes Prim's algorithm starting from vertex F on a 9-vertex graph, demonstrating:
- Greedy edge selection
- Fringe distance updates
- Final MST with total cost of 19

## Deployment
Deployed on Vercel: [Live Demo]()

## Academic Context
Created for CMSC 451 (Algorithms) - Homework 5, Problem 1
